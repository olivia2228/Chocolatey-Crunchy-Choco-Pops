Note-This recipe can serve 12 choco pops

7 brown bread slices(You can also take white bread but brown bread will be ideal as it will mix nicely with the chocolate.)

2 tbsp melted butter

2 tbsp melted compound chocolate,chocolate syrup or choco spread.

2-3 tsp powdered sugar {optional}

100g compound chocolate(I have given the method to make melted compound chocolate in the recipe file but otherwise if you don't have compound chocolate you can use easily available chocolates like dairymilk etc.)

12 skewers or lollipop sticks(if the size of your choco pops is small then you can also use toothpicks.)

suagar sprinklers/shredded almonds
