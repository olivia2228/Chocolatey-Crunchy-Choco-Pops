Step 1-Grind the 7 slices of bread in sets so that there are no lumps.
Step 2-To this mixture add the butter.
Step 3-Give this a mix with light hands.
Step 4-To this add melted compound chocolate/chocolate syrup/choco spread.
Step 5-You can add the sugar if required.
Step 5-Make a tight dough out of the mixture.
Step 6-Roll out balls out of this mixture
Step 7-Chop the chocolate.
Step 8-Melt the chocolate using the double boiler system.

(Method for Double Boiler System)
1-Place a saucepan with water on the stove on medium heat.
2-Heat it until the water comes to a slight simmer.
3-Keep a heatproof bowl with the chocolate in it on top of the saucepan.

Note-Make sure your chocolate is chopped evenly and the water in the saucepan doesn't touch the surface of your bowl.This is important to melt your chocolate slowly and evenly.This melted chocolate will be used to coat the pops.

Step 9-Dip the end of your lollipop stick/skewer/toothpick in the melted chocolate.
Step 10-Pierce the chocolatey tip into the choco pop.(This helps bind the stick with the choco pop.)
Step 11-Repeat this method for the remaining pops.
Step 12-Keep these in your refrigerator for 10-15 min.(This would help them set better.)
Step 13-After this,coat them with the melted chocolate.(shake off the excess chocolate.)
Step 14-Coat them with sugar sprinklers of your choice/shredded almonds(You can use anything other than these too.As mentioned earlier,use your imagination and make them look as fancy as possible) {optional}
Step 15-Take a regular glass and keep the choco pop in it after coating it.
Step 16-Repeat the same method for the remaining choco pops.

Tada!...Your chocolatey crunchy choco pops are ready.
